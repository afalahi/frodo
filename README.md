# Forgerock Do (frodo)

This is the ForgeROck DO (frodo) CLI executable. This is a statically linked binary which can be cross compiled for multiple platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows etc.).

## Features

### Current

- Obtain ForgeRock session token and admin access_tokens for a ForgeRock Identity Cloud or platform (ForgeOps) deployment
- Saving and reading credentials (for multiple ForgeRock deployments) from a configuration file.
- Export, import and pruning of journeys. Export includes scripts referenced by scripted decision nodes and when used with Identity Cloud or ForgeOps, `frodo` also includes Email Templates referenced by the Email Template or Email Suspend nodes.
- Export of IDM configuration
- Configuring a ForgeRock cloud tenant for a specific use case, also called a "recipe"

### Future

- Importing IDM configuration
- Parameter substitution when exporting and importing IDM configuration
- Export and import of other ForgeRock ID Cloud configurations, like OAuth clients, SAML entities etc.
- Export and import of data in ForgeRock ID Cloud

## Limitations

`frodo` can't export passwords (including API secrets, etc), so these need to be manually added back to an imported tree or alternatively, export the source tree to a file, edit the file to add the missing fields before importing. Any dependencies _other than_ scripts and email templates, needed for a journey/tree, must also exist prior to import, for example inner-trees and custom nodes.

## Usage

Depending on your OS, you can invoke `frodo-linux`, `frodo-macos` or `frodo-windows.exe` binary.
`frodo` uses commands and sub-commands to provide the functionality stated above. All commands support the help argument as such

```shell
frodo journey -h 
Usage: frodo journey [options] [command]

Manage journeys/trees.
  ```

### Commands

- [connections](#connections)
- [idm](#idm)
- [info](#info)
- [journey](#journey)
- [logging](#logging)

#### Connections

Use this command to list, add, or delete your connections. The CLI creates connection configurations automatically when you use other commands, so you don't have to run this command to initiate a connection.

##### Examples

List saved connections

```shell
frodo connections list
```

##### Sample output

The command displays the connections found in the **`frodorc`** file, located in the user's directory.

```shell
[Host] : [Username]
- [https://openam-ali-demo.forgeblocks.com/am] : [ali.falahi@forgerock.com]
Any unique substring of a saved host can be used as the value for host parameter in all commands
```

The command below lists all journeys in the specified realm, but the main idea here is when you supply the host, username, and password frodo will automatically save the connection in the **`frodorc`** file

```shell
frodo journey list https://<tenant-name>/am <realm> <username> <password>
```

One the connection is saved, you don't need to include the host, username, and password in your future commands. You'll simply use a substring in your tenant/forgerock deployment domain name to define the connection. For example, my tenant name is `https://demo-uniqueValue.forgeblocks.com/am`

**`uniqueValue`** is a unique substring in my tenant url, and it's unique across my saved connections; this enables me to execute the same command from above as such

```shell
frodo journey list uniqueValue
```

**`frodo`** will automatically parse this unique string, and check your saved connections for a match. It will then use the connection details to authenticate and list journeys.

#### IDM

This command is all about IDM configurations. It supports list, export, and import of IDM entities as well as additional commands available via the help argument. The command supports the same connection persistance we discussed above.

##### Examples

List IDM configuration objects. You'll notice that we don't need to specific the realm here and we're reading from existing connection info

```shell
frodo idm list uniqueValue
```

Or by supplying the host, username, and password

```shell
frodo idm list https://<tenant-name>/am <username> <password>
```

###### Sample output

```shell
Listing all IDM configuration objects...
ForgeRock Identity Cloud detected.
Connected to ForgeRock Access Management 7.2.0-2021-11-SNAPSHOT Build 978ae0d483aa2da07826b3bdff286c60ccb41a4e (2022-February-09 11:40)
- script
- emailTemplate/frPasswordUpdated
- emailTemplate/registration
- secrets
- servletfilter/payload
- emailTemplate/baselineEmailVerification
```

Export IDM configuration to a file. If you don't specify the file option then the configuration will be printed to `STDOUT`. The export is in JSON format. The `-N` options is the name of the configuration object

```shell
frodo idm export ali -N sync -f idm-sync.json
```

#### Info

#### Journey

This will export a journey named `Registration` in `alpha` realm and save the contents in a file called `journey-Registration.json`. If the `-f <filename>` is omitted, the journey JSON data is dumped to STDOUT.

```shell
./frodo-linux journey -h https://<forgerock-cloud-tenant>/am -u <tenant.admin@tenant.com> -p my_5up3rs3cr3tp@ssw0rd import -t ImportTest -r alpha -f journey-ImportTest.json
```

The above will import the same journey.

## Developing

### Prerequisites

- Install nodejs (tested on v14.9.0) and npm (included with node)

### Process

- Clone this repo

```shell
cd $HOME # or any other directory you wish to clone to
git clone git@github.com:rockcarver/frodo.git
```

- Build

```shell
cd $HOME/frodo
npm install
npm install -g pkg
pkg -C GZip .
```

This will build `frodo` in local directory. There are three binaries created

```shell
frodo-linux
frodo-macos
frodo-win.exe
```

### Run

`frodo` is self contained, statically linked, so no dependencies should be needed. It can be run as:

```shell
$HOME/frodo/frodo-linux # or the platform equivalent binary
```
