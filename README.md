# Frodo - ForgeROck DO

This is the ForgeROck DO - or short frodo - command line interface, a CLI to manage ForgeRock platform deployments. Frodo supports Identity Cloud tenants, ForgeOps deployments, and classic deployments.

Frodo is the successor to field tools like [amtree.sh](https://github.com/vscheuber/AM-treetool), [fidc-debug-tools](https://github.com/vscheuber/fidc-debug-tools), and ForgeRock-internal utilities.

## Quick start

1. Download the platform specific binary archive from the [release page](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo/releases) and unzip it to a directory.
2. Open a terminal and change to the above directory.
3. Run `frodo conn add` (example below) to setup `frodo` for your ForgeRock environment. If all parameters are correct, `frodo` creates a new [connection profile](#connection-profiles). If you are offline and don't want to validate the data you enter, you can use the --no-validate paramter and frodo stores the [connection profile](#connection-profiles) without validating it.
```console
$ frodo conn add https://openam-tenant-name.forgeblocks.com/am john.doe@company.com '5uP3r-53cr3t!'
ForgeRock Identity Cloud detected.

```
**NOTE: MacOS and Windows may not let you run `frodo` right after you download (and unzip) and execute it for the very first time. Please refer to [this page](docs/BINARIES.md) if this happens.**

4. Test your connection profile using a simple convenience feature in frodo:
```console
$ frodo info tenant-name
Printing versions and tokens...
ForgeRock Identity Cloud detected.

Cookie name: 6ac6499e9da2071
Session token: g9CMhj7k9Asq...
Bearer token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV...
```
Note how the command does not specify the complete tenant URL nor username nor password. I only uses a unique substring that matches the tenant URL and frodo looks up and uses the right [connection profile](#connection-profiles).

5. Now you can use other frodo commands, like `journey`, `logs`, `applications` etc. as desired. **For detailed usage, refer to [this](#usage)**

## Features

Frodo allows an administrator to easily connect to and manage any number of Identity Cloud tenants, ForgeOps deployment instances, or classic deployment instances from the command line. The following tasks are currently supported:

- User mode

  Install and run pre-compiled single binaries without any dependencies for MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

- Manage journeys/trees.

  Export, import and pruning of journeys. Frodo handles referenced scripts and email templates.

- Manage applications.

  List, export, and import applications (OAuth2 clients).

- Manage connection profiles.

  Saving and reading credentials (for multiple ForgeRock deployments) from a configuration file.

- Manage email templates.

  List, export, and import email templates.

- Manage IDM configuration.

  Export of IDM configuration. Import is coming.

- Print versions and tokens.

  Obtain ForgeRock session token and admin access_tokens for a ForgeRock Identity Cloud or platform (ForgeOps) deployment

- View Identity Cloud logs.

  List available log sources and tail them.

- Manage realms.

  List realms and show realm details. Allow adding and removing of custom DNS names.

- Manage scripts.

  List, export, and import scripts.

- Manage Identity Cloud environment specific variables and secrets.

  List and view details of secrets and variables in Identity Cloud.

- Platform admin tasks.

  Common tasks administrators need to perform daily that are tedious and repetitive. Advanced tasks, which used to be involved and potentially dangerous if performed manually, now made easy and safe.

  - Create an oauth2 client with admin privileges.
  - Get an access token using client credentials grant type.
  - List oauth2 clients with admin privileges.
  - Grant an oauth2 client admin privileges.
  - Revoke admin privileges from an oauth2 client.
  - List oauth2 clients with custom privileges.
  - List all subjects of static user mappings that are not oauth2 clients.
  - Remove a subject's static user mapping.
  - Add AutoId static user mapping to enable dashboards and other AutoId-based functionality.
  - Hide generic extension attributes.
  - Show generic extension attributes.
  - Repair org model (beta).

- Developer mode

  Install and run in developer mode (npm i -g)

## Limitations

`frodo` can't export passwords (including API secrets, etc), so these need to be manually added back to an imported tree or alternatively, export the source tree to a file, edit the file to add the missing fields before importing. Any hard dependencies _other than_ scripts and email templates, needed for a journey/tree, must also exist prior to import, for example inner-trees and custom nodes.

## Installing

### User Mode
Individuals who do not intend to develop or contribute to frodo should use this method. Please refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start)

### Developer Mode
For those who want to contribute or are just curious about the build process.

- Make sure you have Node.js v18 (the version used by developers) or newer and npm.
- Clone this repo
```console
git clone https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo.git
```
- Install via NPM
```console
cd frodo
npm install
npm i -g
```

## Usage

You can invoke `frodo` from the terminal as long as you're in the directory or sourced/added it to the path.

To get started, refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start).

### Connection Profiles
A connection profile is a set of ForgeRock environment URL (Access Management base URL), admin username and admin password. It can optionally contain log API key and secret for a ForgeRock Identity Cloud environment. All connection profiless are stored in `~/.frodo/.frodorc`. Passwords are stored encrypted. `.frodorc` can house information for multiple connections.

Use the `frodo conn` sub-commands to manage connections:
-   `frodo conn list` to list all the connections frodo currently knows about for the current machine and user.
-   `frodo conn add` to add a new connection profile.
-   `frodo conn describe` to see all the details of a connection profile.
-   `frodo conn delete` to remove a connection profile.

Once `frodo` saves a connection, you don't have to provide the `host`, `username`, and `password` arguments. You can reference your connection using any unique substring from your host. This is the most common way users would run frodo. For example, if `https://openam-example-use1-dev.id.forgerock.io/am` and `https://openam-example-use1-staging.id.forgerock.io/am` are two saved ForgeRock connections from previous commands, one would simply use:

```console
frodo info example-use1-dev
```
OR
```console
frodo info example-use1-staging
```
