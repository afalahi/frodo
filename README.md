# Forgerock Do (frodo)

This is the ForgeROck DO (frodo) CLI. This is a statically linked binary which can be cross compiled for multiple platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows etc.).

## Features

### Current

- Obtain ForgeRock session token and admin access_tokens for a ForgeRock Identity Cloud or platform (ForgeOps) deployment
- Saving and reading credentials (for multiple ForgeRock deployments) from a configuration file.
- Export, import and pruning of journeys. Export includes scripts referenced by scripted decision nodes and when used with Identity Cloud or ForgeOps, `frodo` also includes Email Templates referenced by the Email Template or Email Suspend nodes.
- Export of IDM configuration
- Configuring a ForgeRock cloud tenant for a specific use case, also called a "recipe"

### Future

- Importing IDM configuration
- Parameter substitution when exporting and importing IDM configuration
- Export and import of other ForgeRock ID Cloud configurations, like OAuth clients, SAML entities etc.
- Export and import of data in ForgeRock ID Cloud

## Limitations

`frodo` can't export passwords (including API secrets, etc), so these need to be manually added back to an imported tree or alternatively, export the source tree to a file, edit the file to add the missing fields before importing. Any dependencies _other than_ scripts and email templates, needed for a journey/tree, must also exist prior to import, for example inner-trees and custom nodes.

## Getting the binaries

Links to the executables

## Usage

You can invoke `frodo` from the terminal as long as you're in the directory or sourced/added it to the path.

To get started run the command below to get tenant info. This command will also create a connection file and stores it on disk, more on connections later.

```console
frodo info https://login.acme.forgeblocks.io/am <username> <password>
```

Once `frodo` saves a connection, you don't have to provide the `host`, `username`, and `password` arguments. You can reference your connection using any unique substring from your host

```console
frodo info acme
```

You interact with `frodo` using commands and options. You can see the list of options by using the `help` command

```console
frodo help
```

```console
Usage: frodo [options] [command]

Options:
  -v, --version                            output the version number
  -h, --help                               display help for command

Commands:

### Commands

- [connections](#connections)
- [idm](#idm)
- [info](#info)
- [journey](#journey)
- [logging](#logging)

#### Connections

Use this command to list, add, or delete your connections. `frodo` saves connection info automatically when you use other commands like in our `info` command.

##### Examples

List saved connections

```console
frodo connections list
```

##### Sample output

The command displays the connections found in the **`frodorc`** file, located in `$USERHOME/.frodo/.frodorc`.

```console
[Host] : [Username]
- [https://login.acme.com/am] : [username]
Any unique substring of a saved host can be used as the value for host parameter in all commands
```

#### IDM

This command is all about IDM configurations. It supports list, export, and import of IDM entities as well as additional commands available via the help argument. The command supports the same connection persistance we discussed above.

##### Examples

List IDM configuration objects. You'll notice that we don't need to specific the realm here and we're reading from existing connection info

```console
frodo idm list acme
```

Or by supplying the host, username, and password

```console
frodo idm list https://login.acme.forgeblocks.io/am <username> <password>
```

###### Sample output

```console
Listing all IDM configuration objects...
ForgeRock Identity Cloud detected.

- script
- emailTemplate/frPasswordUpdated
- emailTemplate/registration
- secrets
- servletfilter/payload
- emailTemplate/baselineEmailVerification
```

Exports IDM configuration in JSON format to a file or `STDOUT` if you don't specify the file option. The `-N` option is the name of the configuration object

```console
frodo idm export acme -N <configuration-name> -f <file-name.json>
```

```console
frodo idm export https://login.acme.forgeblocks.io/am <username> <password> -N <configuration-name> -f <file-name.json>
```

#### Info

`info` prints version information, session token, access token, and tokenId to `STDOUT`.

##### Examples

```console
frodo info acme
```

```console
frodo info <https://login.acme.forgeblocks.io/am> <username> <password>
```

##### Sample output

```console
Printing versions and tokens...

Session token: <your-session-token>
Bearer token: <your-bearer-token>
```

#### Journey

The journey command can list, export, import, prune and describe journeys in a specific realm. You can view all options by using `frodo help journey` command.

#### Examples

These examples assume a saved connection

List all Journeys in a realm

```console
frodo journey list acme <realm-name>
```

Export a specific journey. If you don't supply the `-f` options `frodo` will generate a filename based on the journey name

```console
frodo journey export acme <realm-name> -t <journey-name>
```

Import a Journey from a `JSON` file

```console
frodo journey import acme <realm-name> -t <journey-name> -f <file-name>
```

#### Logging

Todo

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what and why you'd like to change.

## Developing

### Prerequisites

- Install nodejs (tested on v14.9.0 and 16.13.0) and npm (included with node)

### Process

#### Clone this repo

```console
cd $HOME # or any other directory you wish to clone to
git clone git@github.com:rockcarver/frodo.git
```

#### Install via NPM

```console
cd $HOME/frodo
npm install
npm i -g
```

frodo will be installed as a global npm package. This method is helpful when developing and testing.

#### Build

To build locally we need to do a couple of extra steps due to a limitation with the `pkg` module we're using to distribute binaries. `pkg` [doesn't support ES6](https://github.com/vercel/pkg/issues/1291) modules as of yet, so we have to transpile to commonJS then build.

There should be a `dist` folder when you cloned the repo from Github, the binaries will get pushed there. We're using a `gulp` script to transpile ES6 module to commonJS and then `pkg` can create the binary for the respective OS. For Mac OS you'll have to sign the binary

##### For windows and Linux

```console
cd $HOME/frodo
npm install
npm install -g pkg gulp
gulp
cd ./dist
npm i
#For Windows
pkg -C Gzip -t node16-win-x64 --out-path bin/win .
#For Linux
pkg -C Gzip -t node16-linux-x64 --out-path bin/linux .
```

##### For MacOS

For MacOS we need to sign the binaries with an Apple Developer Cert.

```console
# create variables
CERTIFICATE_PATH=<YOUR_CERTIFICATE_PATH>
INTERMEDIATE_CERTIFICATE_PATH=<YOUR_INTERMEDIATE_CERTIFICATE_PATH>
KEYCHAIN_PATH=<YOUR_TEMP_KEYCHAIN_PATH>
KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD=<KEY_CHAIN_PASSWORD>
DEVELOPMENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE=<YOUR_CERT_PASSPHRASE>

#create temp keychain
security create-keychain -p "$KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD" $KEYCHAIN_PATH
security set-keychain-settings -lut 21600 $KEYCHAIN_PATH
security unlock-keychain -p "$KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD" $KEYCHAIN_PATH

#import certs to keychain
security import $CERTIFICATE_PATH -P "$DEVELOPMENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE" -A -t cert -f pkcs12 -k $KEYCHAIN_PATH
security import $INTERMEDIATE_CERTIFICATE_PATH -P "$DEVELOPMENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE" -A -t cert -f pkcs12 -k $KEYCHAIN_PATH
security list-keychain -d user -s $KEYCHAIN_PATH

# import certificate to keychain
security import $CERTIFICATE_PATH -P "$DEVELOPMENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE" -A -t cert -f pkcs12 -k $KEYCHAIN_PATH
security import $INTERMEDIATE_CERTIFICATE_PATH -P "$DEVELOPMENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE" -A -t cert -f pkcs12 -k $KEYCHAIN_PATH
security list-keychain -d user -s $KEYCHAIN_PATH

cd $HOME/frodo
npm install
npm install -g pkg gulp
gulp

cd ./dist
npm i
pkg -C Gzip -t node16-macos-x64 --out-path bin/macos .

cd ./dist/bin/macos
codesign -f -s 'DEV_ID' --timestamp --deep frodo
```

This will build `frodo` in each local directory respective to the OS target you chose

```console
./dist/bin/linux/frodo
./dist/bin/macos/frodo
./dist/bin/win/frodo
```

#### Run

`frodo` is self contained, statically linked, so no dependencies should be needed. It can be run as:

```console
$HOME/frodo/frodo # or the platform equivalent binary
```

We recommend sourcing, or adding it to the path if you're on windows, to make it easier to call from your terminal without switching directories
